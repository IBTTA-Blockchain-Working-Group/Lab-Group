Stable Coin Act and its Implications
=========================================
`Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement (STABLE) Act <https://tlaib.house.gov/sites/tlaib.house.gov/files/STABLEAct.pdf>`__ attempts to capture the issues involved in working with stablecoins and the risks that unregulated issuance of stable coins pose. In the case of IBTTA, stable coins backed by OCC or the Federal Reserve could offset the risk of using stable coins. This approach to managing inter-agency tariffs and customer tariffs could help reduce the cost of transactions as well as improve transparency among agencies to help manage and apportion risks.
