Stable Coin Act and its Implications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement (STABLE) Act <https://tlaib.house.gov/sites/tlaib.house.gov/files/STABLEAct.pdf>`__ attempts to capture the issues involved in working with stablecoins and the risks that unregulated issuance of stable coins pose. In the case of IBTTA, stable coins backed by OCC or the Federal Reserve could offset the risk of using stable coins. This approach to managing inter-agency tariffs and customer tariffs could help reduce the cost of transactions as well as improve transparency among agencies to help manage and apportion risks.


Privacy concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The information that needs to be stored on the ledger needs to be the minimum to associate a contract with a tag owner or the agency. This association needs to be saved outside the ledger so that for example the license plate number is not published as part of an event from inside a contract. One approach would be to build this association as part of the application server hosted within an agency's infrastructure.
