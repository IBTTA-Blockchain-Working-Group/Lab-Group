### Contributor Code of Conduct

We, the contributors and maintainers of this project, pledge to respect all participants who contribute through revising code, opening issues, patching branches, and any other methods of aiding the project. We will ensure that the environment surrounding this project shall be open and friendly to all who aim to learn or contribute, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

  - The use of sexualized language or imagery
  - Personal attacks
  - Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
  - Public or private harassment
  - Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
  - Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.
This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior in this project or any of its sanctioned media spaces may be reported by contacting the IBTTA Blockchain Working Group via matt@milliganpartners.com. You can expect a response within X business days.
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant (http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.2.0, available at http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/
 


## Communication
### Appropriate Content for Community Resources
All communications related to this project are subject to the Contributor Code of Conduct. Communications resources dedicated to this project are intended to be used by contributors and moderators of the project, so commercial usage of these resources will be moderated. Note that while commercial content is allowed, unsolicited commercial content mostly is NOT.

Examples of inappropriate content:
  - Posting unsolicited content of a commercial nature on Slack or other community forums
  - Messaging people individually on a platform with content of an unsolicited commercial nature
  - Unsolicited pitching of commercial products during a Blockchain Working Group meeting

Examples of appropriate content:
  - Asking about commercial products in an appropriate channel. For example most subgroups have a channel on Slack, so asking if a blockchain platform is viable for experimentation in the Lab subgroup is allowed.
"Does anyone have experience with project foo?" is fine

### Decisions Are Made Here
The project is very large with a robust community group ecosystem and bubbling up information is important. Transparency is necessary and these channels are key:
