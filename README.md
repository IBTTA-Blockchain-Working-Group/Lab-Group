Though we use the term "lab" we consider us to be a bunch of like-minded folks who like to maintain a collegial environment to exchange and bounce off ideas/code etc. If you see anything you like or don't like, please send us a note and we will be happy to discuss them and perhaps create a user story or two to memorialize them.
